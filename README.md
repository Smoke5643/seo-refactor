## Description of project


Through the techniques we have been taught in our bootcamp thus far, I have optimized this application for search engines. This was completed by three main steps. First, I added meta tags for description and keywords. Then, I updated the title from something generic to something that matched the writing in the application as well as the company name. Last, I changed generic tags to semantic tags.

The next step was to consolidate some classes in the html that were redundant in the style sheet as well. Cleaning up the style sheet to match. There was also a broken link for Search Engine Optimization due to a missing id that I added. Through all of this, I added comments to show anyone viewing the new code what I had done.

All changes where pushed to Github periodically to backup my work and allow anyone following the project to see the progression.
